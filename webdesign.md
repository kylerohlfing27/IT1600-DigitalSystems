## My Interest In Web Design

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

I've been interested in web development since taking Web Development 1 with the University of Missouri.
I then continued on and took Web Development 2, which was a pain in the ass, but overall was a cool class.

This drove me further into the field of web development and I took an internship over the summer of 2020 at a startup which focused on web application development.

I now want to use my skills I've gained and help small businesses by making webpages for them and draw in more customers.
