Storage Installation
=============

Many cases have spaces built in to hold storage untis so they do not float around the case freely.

1. Secure the hard drive in the storage unit, making sure it locks into place.

2. Secure the SSD in a secure place, since it will not lock into the HDD slot.

3. Connect both of these units via SATA cables to the motherboard. These cables transfer the data to the system.

4. Connect the units to the power supply with the provided SATA power cables.
