RAM Installation
=============

RAM is very easy to install, assuming you got the correct type of RAM for your motherboard.

1. Make sure you have the correct slots selected, since we only have 2 sticks of RAM. From the left, the first and third slots of RAM are optimized for 2 stick usage. If we had 4 sticks of RAM we could use all 4 slots and everything would be fine.

2. Lift the arm locks on the sides of the stick slots.

3. Ensure the stick is facing the correct direction, one side will be shorter than the other.

4. Press firmly on both sides until the arm locks press down.
