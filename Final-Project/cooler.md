CPU Cooler Installation
=============

1. We are going to start by installing the reservior at the front of our computer case. You need to align the fans and reservior with solid metal components on the frame of the case. I was able to mount mine in the display slot at the front of my case.

2. Once the tank is secured, you can install the pump onto the processor. Mine came with thermal paste already applied to the pump, but if yours does not have thermal paste where the pump contacts the processor, you will need to get some. This is to transfer heat more efficiently to the cooler.

3. Make sure the pump lines are not tangled or interfering with any parts around the computer.

4. Plug in the pump to the motherboard. There should be a 3 pin connector near the processor for AIO_PUMP or All-In-One Pump. this is going to be powered by the PSU.
