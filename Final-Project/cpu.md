CPU Installation
=============

1. Take the CPU out of the box and prepare it near the motherboard.

2. Lift out the lever lock that is securing the processor socket cover. Once this is unlocked you can lift the cover to reveal the pins inside the socket.

3. Make sure the processor is oriented correctly to be placed into the socket. You do not want to bend or damage any pins in the socket or on the processor in this process. You can ensure the position is correct with the small golden arrow in the bottm-left of the processor. It should match with an arrow in the socket.

4. Once the processor is placed into the socket, you can set the cover back on the processor in the socket and slowly place the lever back down. You can begin applying pressure to press the processor down into the socket. It's going to make a crisp noise which is scary at first but it is totally normal.

Now we can move on to cooler installation.
