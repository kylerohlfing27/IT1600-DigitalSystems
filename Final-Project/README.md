# Intro
### Building a Desktop Computer
### Kyle Rohlfing

The purpose of this tutorial is to help anyone who is interested in building a desktop computer, be it for work or for playing games, will have a step by step tutorial for putting pieces together to make an operating machine. It can be a daunting task when first learning about all of the parts that go into making a computer work, but it's actually fairly simple once you learn about what all of the parts do and where they belong. I will walk through the basic parts of a computer, what they do, and where they belong when building a computer to help make the process easier for beginners looking for a simple tutorial.

My target audience is anyone who is looking to build a desktop computer. The tutorial will mainly apply to people who are looking to build a computer for gaming, but this still applies to any level of PC building. This is just because the parts I will be talking about are intended to be used for high intensity processing such as high-end gaming. This tutorial will also be helpful for anyone looking to learn more about how a computer operates down to a more complex level.
