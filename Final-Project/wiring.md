Wiring Guide
=============

When dealing with wiring, you are going to need to route wires all the way to the other side of the PC.

This can get pretty messy, so I recommend running the wires behind the motherboard so that they are all hidden. This will make sure your computer looks clean and makes sure you can access all of your components when needed.

To get started with wiring, remove the back panel of the case so you can access this area behind the motherboard. Then you can start running the wires from the PSU to their respective parts in the neatest way possible. I like to use zip ties when building computers to keep everything tidy and in place.

You will also need to connect the case wires to the motherboard so that the physical components can interact with the computer's. A guide to connecting these wires is usually found in the _motherboard's_ manual and can be kind of tricky to get connected. Just pay attention to which cable is which.

Now you can power it on and hopefully it turns on.
