Picking Parts
=============

You are going to need 8 main components to build a desktop computer. These parts include:
* Case (Full ATX Size in order to fit the motherboard)
* Motherboard (ATX Size Motherboard. This is to ensure we have enough room for our parts.)
* CPU (Processor)
* Processor Cooler
* RAM
* Storage Units
* Graphics Card (GPU)
* Power Supply

Case
-----
When picking a case you're going to want to go Full-Tower or Full-ATX when looking for the size. This just ensures that we have enough space for our motherboard and all of the parts inside of the computer. I like getting computer cases with glass panels on the side so you can view the computer while it's on. There are many different options when picking cases and you can customize the case however you would like.
