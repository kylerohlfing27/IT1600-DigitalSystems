Picking Parts
=============

You are going to need 8 main components to build a desktop computer. These parts include:
* Case - (Full ATX Size in order to fit the motherboard)
* Motherboard - (ATX Size Motherboard. This is to ensure we have enough room for our parts.)
* CPU (Processor)
* Processor Cooler
* RAM
* Storage Units
* Graphics Card (GPU)
* Power Supply

Case
-----
When picking a case you're going to want to go Full-Tower or Full-ATX when looking for the size. This just ensures that we have enough space for our motherboard and all of the parts inside of the computer. I like getting computer cases with glass panels on the side so you can view the computer while it's on. There are many different options when picking cases and you can customize the case however you would like.

Motherboard
-----
The motherboard I have chosen for my PC is the [Gigabyte Z390 GAMING X-CF](https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/Z390-GAMING-X-rev-10#kf).

I chose this motherboard because it supports the 9th Generation Intel processor I wanted to put in my computer. It also haas 2 PCIe slots as well as 4 slots of RAM and the BIOS system is very nice. This is a Full-ATX Motherboard and fits with the standard measurements when dealing with ATX sized components. This also ensures that there is enough space for the components we want to install.

Central Processing Unit (CPU)
-----
The processor we are going to be installing is the Intel [i7-9700k](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/186604/intel-core-i7-9700k-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-90-ghz.html). I chose this processor because it has great speeds right out of the box and is overclockable. I know this becuase of the 'k' that is included at the end of the name of the processor. With overclocking on this card it can reach clock speeds of 4.9GHz.

CPU Cooler
-----
When the CPU is running and on, it generates a lot of heat. You are going to need to cool it off somehow and we can do this with many cooling systems designed just for processors. You can choose Air Cooling - which utilizes fans attached to heatsinks that wick heat away from the metal components of the processor and cool them off with the fans. The other type of cooler is a water-cooled system that heats up the fluid with a socket that makes contact with the processing unit and takes it back to a reservior that cools off the temperature.

I chose the [NZXT Kraken X53](https://www.newegg.com/nzxt-liquid-cooling-system-kraken-x/p/N82E16835146066?item=N82E16835146066&source=region&nm_mc=knc-googleadwords-pc&cm_mmc=knc-googleadwords-pc-_-pla-_-liquid+%2f+water+cooling-_-N82E16835146066&gclsrc=ds) for my water cooler because it has a large tank that can cool the water quickly as well as a nice light up pump that sits on my processor.

RAM
-----
RAM is vital to a computer's operation because it stores information used by the operating system as well as applications that is temporary and used for calculations or operations only then destroyed. For this build we are going to be installing 2 DDR4 RAM Sticks so the computer will be able to operate.

Storage
-----
There are two major different types of storage in computers today. Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD). Hard drives have a physical disk that the computer writes and stores data to. These systems are slower but are usually more affordable than their SSD counterparts. SSDs are computer components and have no moving parts. they access memory written to the storage itself and are much faster. I like to have both of these in a configuration as to take advantage of the speed of SSDs but get the storage capacity of HDDs.

Graphics Card (GPU)
-----
This is one of the most important pieces in a gaming desktop computer. This piece of hardware takes on all of the visual calcuations and is devoted just for graphical processing. Unfortunately due to the crypto market boom, graphics cards are very hard to come by and are very expensive. I am installing a [GTX 1070](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/geforce/products/10series/geforce-gtx-1070/).

Power Supply (PSU)
-----
The power supply is where the computer draws in power from an external source and moderates it to a voltage that is acceptable for the parts inside. This is also where you will connect all of your parts so they can receive power. It is important to get a power supply that can provide enough power to all of your components or the computer may not work properly.

I Chose the [NZXT C750](https://www.nzxt.com/products/c750) due to its price as well as the Gold certified rating for wattages. This ensures a very good standard for the electrical components inside the Power Supply. The power supply can also provide 750 watts of power which is more than enough to cover all of my components.
