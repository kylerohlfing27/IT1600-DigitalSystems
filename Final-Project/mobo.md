Motherboard Installation
=============

1. To get started with installing the motherboard, the case needs to be fully opened and set up.

2. Next, the motherboard should have come with small risers that screw in to the back panel of the case as to keep the motherboard's rear pins from touching the back panel.

3. There should have been around 6 risers that come with the motherboard. Once all of them are set in place, the motherboard should not be able to move.

Keep the computer case on its side and we can move on to the next page.
