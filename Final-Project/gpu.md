Graphics Card Installation
=============

The graphics card is fairly easy to install, it just needs to be secure as it does not have much support.

1. Remove one of the IO port covers on the back of the case where the PCI-e slot is so the back of the card is exposed outside of the case. These are usually held in by thumb screws.

2. Ensure the PCI-e slot on the motherboard is unlocked with the swing-arm lock.

3. Firmly press the graphics card into the slot, making sure the component locks into the motherboard.

4. Reinstall the thumb screw to the IO port on the back of the computer in the graphics card's support slot.
