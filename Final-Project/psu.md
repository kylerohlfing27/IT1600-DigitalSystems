Power Supply Installation
=============

1. The power supply usually goes at the bottom of the case. Make sure the switch is turned 'OFF' as any kind of electrical connection runs the risk of shorting your parts during assembly.

2. Screw the power supply in to the bottom of your case fram so that it fits securely and is not loose.

3. Lay out all of the power cables that came with the power supply to be ready for connection.

4. Begin plugging in the cables to the power supply so they are ready to be routed to their respective components.
