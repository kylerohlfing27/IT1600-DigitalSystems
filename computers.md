## My Interest In Computers

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

I started building my own computer when I was 16. I was fascinated by all the different parts and many of my friends were also getting into building their own computers to play games on.

I started learning everything I could about building a computer and saved up my money to purchase all of the parts in summer of 2015.
Many parts work together and are required to make a computer run. Such as:

* Motherboard
* Processor (CPU)
* RAM
* Graphics Card (GPU)
* Power Supply
* Storage (SSD/HDD)
* Case

I am angry that cryptocurrency has obliterated to market for graphics cards as I want to upgrade my current graphics card but they are always sold out.
