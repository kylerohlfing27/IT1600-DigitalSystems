## My Interest In Hiking

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

I enjoy hiking in Colorado. I've been to the rockies many times and love every time I go.

I want to get into backpacking and get my own gear so I can go on longer hikes through the mountains and camp out on a trail.

One of my favorite trails I've hiked is **Sky Pond Trail** in the Rocky Mountain National Park.
